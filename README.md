This is an enhanced version of the easySlider jQuery plugin originally developed by Alen Grakalic.

For more information about the original version, see http://cssglobe.com/post/5780/easy-slider-17-numeric-navigation-jquery-slider.

I have added the following additional options:

* controlsAppendTo:
  Specify a target to which the controls will be appended.
  By default, the controls are appended inline after the slider div.
