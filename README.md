Overview
=======

The easySlider jQuery plugin allows you to display images or any other content within a slider. You can configure it to slide the contents vertically or horizontally, and you can fully style it with CSS.

It was originally created by Alen Grakalic: http://cssglobe.com/post/5780/easy-slider-17-numeric-navigation-jquery-slider.

Enhancements
----------------------

I enhanced it to include the following option:

* controlsAppendTo: 
  
  Specify a target to which the controls will be appended.
  By default, the controls are appended inline after the slider div.
